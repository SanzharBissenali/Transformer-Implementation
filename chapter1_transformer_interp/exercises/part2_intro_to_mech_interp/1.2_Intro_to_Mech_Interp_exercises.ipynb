        "This section is designed to get you up to speed with the TransformerLens library. You'll learn how to load and run models, and learn about the shared architecture template for all of these models (the latter of which should be familiar to you if you've already done the exercises that come before these, since many of the same design principles are followed).\n",

        "Next, you'll learn about hooks, which are a great feature of TransformerLens allowing you to access and intervene on activations within the model. We will mainly focus on the basics of hooks and using them to access activations (we'll mainly save the causal interventions for the later IOI exercises). You will also build some tools to perform logit attribution within your model, so you can identify which components are responsible for your model's performance on certain tasks.\n",

        "Lastly, these exercises show you how you can reverse-engineer a circuit by looking directly at a transformer's weights (which can be considered a \"gold standard\" of interpretability; something not possible in every situation). You'll examine QK and OV circuits by multiplying through matrices (and learn how the FactoredMatrix class makes matrices like these much easier to analyse). You'll also look for evidence of composition between two induction heads, and once you've found it then you'll investigate the functionality of the full circuit formed from this composition.\n",

        "This is a demo notebook for [TransformerLens](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens), **a library I ([Neel Nanda](neelnanda.io)) wrote for doing [mechanistic interpretability](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/) of GPT-2 Style language models.** The goal of mechanistic interpretability is to take a trained model and reverse engineer the algorithms the model learned during training from its weights. It is a fact about the world today that we have computer programs that can essentially speak English at a human level (GPT-3, PaLM, etc), yet we have no idea how they work nor how to write one ourselves. This offends me greatly, and I would like to solve this! Mechanistic interpretability is a very young and small field, and there are a *lot* of open problems - if you would like to help, please try working on one! **Check out my [list of concrete open problems](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WONBzNqfKIxERejrrPlQMyKqg7jSFW92x5UMXNrMdPo/edit#) to figure out where to start.**\n",
        "\n",
        "I wrote this library because after I left the Anthropic interpretability team and started doing independent research, I got extremely frustrated by the state of open source tooling. There's a lot of excellent infrastructure like HuggingFace and DeepSpeed to *use* or *train* models, but very little to dig into their internals and reverse engineer how they work. **This library tries to solve that**, and to make it easy to get into the field even if you don't work at an industry org with real infrastructure! The core features were heavily inspired by [Anthropic's excellent Garcon tool](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/garcon/index.html). Credit to Nelson Elhage and Chris Olah for building Garcon and showing me the value of good infrastructure for accelerating exploratory research!\n",
        "\n",
        "The core design principle I've followed is to enable exploratory analysis - one of the most fun parts of mechanistic interpretability compared to normal ML is the extremely short feedback loops! The point of this library is to keep the gap between having an experiment idea and seeing the results as small as possible, to make it easy for **research to feel like play** and to enter a flow state. This notebook demonstrates how the library works and how to use it, but if you want to see how well it works for exploratory research, check out [my notebook analysing Indirect Objection Identification](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens/blob/main/Exploratory_Analysis_Demo.ipynb) or [my recording of myself doing research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo4QvDn-vsU)!"

        "TransformerLens appends this token by default, and it can easily trip up new users. Notably, **this includes** `model.forward` (which is what's implicitly used when you do eg `model(\"Hello World\")`). You can disable this behaviour by setting the flag `prepend_bos=False` in `to_tokens`, `to_str_tokens`, `model.forward` and any other function that converts strings to multi-token tensors.\n",
        "\n",
        "`prepend_bos` is a bit of a hack, and I've gone back and forth on what the correct default here is. The reason I do this is that transformers tend to treat the first token weirdly - this doesn't really matter in training (where all inputs are >1000 tokens), but this can be a big issue when investigating short prompts! The reason for this is that attention patterns are a probability distribution and so need to add up to one, so to simulate being \"off\" they normally look at the first token. Giving them a BOS token lets the heads rest by looking at that, preserving the information in the first \"real\" token.\n",

        "\n",
        "A key insight from the Mathematical Frameworks paper is that we should focus on interpreting the parts of the model that are intrinsically interpretable - the input tokens, the output logits and the attention patterns. Everything else (the residual stream, keys, queries, values, etc) are compressed intermediate states when calculating meaningful things. So a natural place to start is classifying heads by their attention patterns on various texts.\n",
        "\n",
        "When doing interpretability, it's always good to begin by visualising your data, rather than taking summary statistics. Summary statistics can be super misleading! But now that we have visualised the attention patterns, we can create some basic summary statistics and use our visualisations to validate them! (Accordingly, being good at web dev/data visualisation is a surprisingly useful skillset! Neural networks are very high-dimensional object.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's visualize the attention pattern of all the heads in layer 0, using [Alan Cooney's CircuitsVis library](https://github.com/alan-cooney/CircuitsVis) (based on Anthropic's PySvelte library). If you did the previous set of exercises, you'll have seen this library before.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use the function `cv.attention.attention_patterns`, which takes two important arguments:\n",
        "\n",
        "* `attention`: the attention head patterns, of shape `[n_heads, seq_len, seq_len]`. This consists of the stacked grid of attention probabilities for each head, i.e. `attention[head, d, s]` is the attention probability from destination position `d` to source position `s` in attention head `head`.\n",
        "* `tokens`: List of tokens, which should have the same length as the `seq_len` dimension of `attention`. Make sure you're not accidentally passing in a list with a dummy dimension, or that differs from `seq_len` because of the BOS token!\n",
        "\n",
        "This visualization is interactive! Try hovering over a token or head, and click to lock. The grid on the top left and for each head is the attention pattern as a destination position by source position grid. It's lower triangular because GPT-2 has **causal attention**, attention can only look backwards, so information can only move forwards in the network.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Note - you can also use the `cv.attention.attention_heads` function, which presents the data in a different way (the syntax is exactly the same as `attention_patterns`). Note, if you display this in VSCode then it may exhibit a bug where the main plot continually shrinks in size - if this happens, you should instead save the HTML (i.e. with `html = cv.attention.attention_heads(...); with open(\"attn_heads.html\", \"w\") as f: f.write(str(html))`) and open the plot in your browser."

This means that **the residual stream can't directly encode positional information**.\n",

        "    * Phase changes are particularly interesting (and depressing) from an alignment perspective, because the prospect of a sharp left turn, or emergent capabilities like deception or situational awareness seems like worlds where alignment may be harder, and we get caught by surprise without warning shots or simpler but analogous models to test our techniques on.\n",
        "* They are responsible for a significant loss decrease - so much so that there's a visible bump in the loss curve when they develop (this change in loss can be pretty comparable to the increase in loss from major increases in model size, though this is hard to make an apples-to-apples comparison)\n",
        "* They seem to be responsible for the vast majority of in-context learning - the ability to use far back tokens in the context to predict the next token. This is a significant way in which transformers outperform older architectures like RNNs or LSTMs, and induction heads seem to be a big part of this.\n",

        "\n",
        "[PyTorch hooks](https://blog.paperspace.com/pytorch-hooks-gradient-clipping-debugging/) are a great and underrated, yet incredibly janky, feature. They can act on a layer, and edit the input or output of that layer, or the gradient when applying autodiff. The key difference is that **Hook points** act on *activations* not layers. This means that you can intervene within a layer on each activation, and don't need to care about the precise layer structure of the transformer. And it's immediately clear exactly how the hook's effect is applied. This adjustment was shamelessly inspired by [Garcon's use of ProbePoints](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/garcon/index.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "They also come with a range of other quality of life improvements. PyTorch's hooks are global state, which can be a massive pain if you accidentally leave a hook on a model. TransformerLens hooks are also global state, but `run_with_hooks` tries to create an abstraction where these are local state by removing all hooks at the end of the function (and they come with a helpful `model.reset_hooks()` method to remove all hooks).\n",

Mean ablation on the other hand works slightly better (although it does come with its own set of risks).

        "- **Head `0.7` is truly a previous token head.** The second row shows that mean ablating all its inputs except for those that come from the previous token has no effect on loss, so this is all the information it's using.\n",
        "- **Head `0.11` is only a current token head.** The first row shows that mean ablating all its inputs except for those that come from self-attending (i.e. to the current token) has no effect on loss, so this is all the information it's using.\n",
        "- **Head `0.4` is only using information from positions 1, 2 or 3 tokens back.** This is shown from the 5th row of the plot above - the effect of ablating all inputs except for those that come from tokens 1 or 2 positions back is very small. Note that it's important we draw this conclusion from an ablation experiment, not just from looking at attention patterns - because attending to a token doesn't tell you whether that token is being used for a way that's important in the context of this particular distribution (induction).\n",
        "\n",
        "Starting with `0.11` - we know that there are heads in layer 1 whose job it is to copy tokens - i.e. in sequences `[A][B]...[A][B]`, they attend from the second `[A]` back to the first `[B]` and copy its value to use as a prediction. And if head `0.11` always self-attends, then it actually makes sense to consider `(embedding of B) + (output of head 0.11 when it attends to token B)` as the \"true embedding of `B`\", since this is always the thing that the layer 1 head will be learning to copy. This idea of an **extended embedding** or **effective embedding** will come up again later in the course, when we look at GPT2-Small. As for whether the output of `0.11` is more important in the QK circuit of the layer-1 copying head, or the OV copying head, we'll leave as an exercise to the reader!\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, `0.4` - it's using information from both 1 and 2 tokens back. Using the previous token makes sense, since induction circuits contain previous token heads. But what could it be doing with the information 2 positions back? One theory we might have is that it's also creating an induction circuit, but using 3 tokens rather than 2 tokens! In other words, rather than having sequences like `[A][B]...[A][B]` where the second `[A]` attends back to \"token that came immediately after the value of this token\", we might have sequences like `[Z][A][B]...[Z][A][B]` where the second `[A]` attends back to \"token that came 2 positions after the value of the previous token\". One way to test this would be to construct random induction sequences which have a maximum of 2 repetitions, i.e. they're constructed with the first half being random sequences and the second half being pairs of randomly chosen tokens which appear in the first half adjacent to each other. To illustrate, for vocab size of 10 and half seq len of 10, we might have a sequence like:\n",

        "* We also saw that head `0.7` strongly attends to the previous token in the sequence (even on non-repeated sequences).\n",
        "* We performed **logit attribution** on the model, and found that the values written to the residual stream by heads `1.4` and `1.10` were both important for getting us correct predictions in the second half of the sequence.\n",
        "* We performed **zero-ablation** on the model, and found that heads `0.7`, `1.4` and `1.10` all resulted in a large accuracy degradation on the repeated sequence task when they were ablated.\n",

But if two heads are deliberately composing, then they will likely want to ensure they write and read from similar subspaces, so that minimal information is lost.

A B`, then it's the QK circuit's job to make sure the second `A` attends to the first `B`, and it's the OV circuit's job to project the residual vector at that position onto the **embedding space** in order to extract the `B`-information, while hopefully ignoring anything else that has been written to that position by the heads in layer 0). So once again, this is a good sign for our composition scores.\n",

The singular values of $M$ don't change when we multiply it by an orthogonal matrix (only the matrices $U$ and $V$ will change, not $S$), so it remains to show that the Frobenius norm also won't change when we multiply $M$ by an orthogonal matrix. But this follows from the fact that the Frobenius norm is the sum of the squared $l_2$ norms of the column vectors of $M$, and orthogonal matrices preserve $l_2$ norms. (If we're right-multiplying $M$ by an orthogonal matrix, then we instead view this as performing orthogonal operations on the row vectors of $M$, and the same argument holds.)\n",

        "\n",
        "Anthropic has written a post on [In-context Learning and Induction Heads](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html) which goes into much deeper discussion on induction heads. The post is structured around six different points of evidence for the hypothesis that **induction heads are the main source of in-context learning in transformer models**, even large ones. Briefly, these are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Transformers undergo a \"phase change\" where they suddenly become much better at in-context learning, and this is around the same time induction heads appear.\n",
        "2. When we change the transformer's architecture to make it easier for induction heads to form, we get a corresponding improvement in in-context learning.\n",
        "3. When we ablate induction heads at runtime, in-context learning gets worse.\n",
        "4. We have specific examples of induction heads performing more complex in-context learning algorithms (you'll have the opportunity to investigate one of these later - **indirect object identification**).\n",
        "5. We have a mechanistic explanation of induction heads, which suggests natural extensions to more general forms of in-context learning.\n",
        "6. In-context learning-related behaviour is generally smoothly continuous between small and large models, suggesting that the underlying mechanism is also the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are a few questions for you:\n",
        "\n",
        "* How compelling do you find this evidence? Discuss with your partner.\n",
        "    * Which points do you find most compelling?\n",
        "    * Which do you find least compelling?\n",
        "    * Are there any subset of these which would be enough to convince you of the hypothesis, in the absence of others?\n",
        "* In point 3, the paper observes that in-context learning performance degrades when you ablate induction heads. While we measured this by testing the model's ability to copy a duplicated random sequence, the paper used **in-context learning score** (the loss of the 500th token in the context, minus the loss on the 50th token).\n",
        "    * Can you see why this is a reasonable metric?\n",
        "    * Can you replicate these results (maybe on a larger model than the 2-layer one we've been using)?\n",
        "* In point 4 (more complex forms of in-context learning), the paper suggests the natural extension of \"fuzzy induction heads\", which match patterns like `[A*][B*]...[A][B]` rather than `[A][B]...[A][B]` (where the `*` indicates some form of linguistic similarity, not necessarily being the same token).\n",
        "    * Can you think of any forms this might take, i.e. any kinds of similarity which induction heads might pick up on? Can you generate examples?"
